How to properly file an issue.
------------------------------
* Use a "Title" that will globally describe the issue but will ease future lookup for reference. ie: (web admin): Not able to delete Zayme admin account
* No need for a novel but it should explain how to replicate if required to, otherwise give the big picture. Also explain impacted services and possible resolution (if any)
* Use appropriate(s) "Labels"
* Set the appropriate "Milestone"

* If the issue needs to be discussed internally in a meeting, add the "question" label.
