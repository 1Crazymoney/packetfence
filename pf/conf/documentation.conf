Interval at which poisoned ARPs ("traps") are sent to infected/unregistered systems.
EOT

[arp.strobe]
type=toggle
options=enabled|disabled
description=<<EOT
If enabled, sends ARP request to all IP addresses within range immediately after startup.  This allows for the internal MAC 
to IP mappings to be populated quickly.
EOT

[arp.gw_timeout]
type=time
description=<<EOT
Used in detection of systems with statically-defined gateway ARP entries.  If a system has not ARPed for the gateway 
within this interval, it is removed from the IP->MAC mappings and should be flagged as rogue by the next probe.
EOT

[arp.timeout]
type=time
description=<<EOT
Length of time of inactivity after which an unresponsive system is aged out.  Hello ARPs are sent at timeout/2 
and timeout-interval to avoid prematurely timing out a system.
EOT

[arp.dhcp_timeout]
type=time
description=<<EOT
Used in detection of systems with static IP addresses.  Looks for broadcast DHCPDISCOVERs and flags a node as rogue if it 
fails to see one before timer is exceeded.  This value should be greater than 50% of your DHCP lease time.
EOT

[arp.listendevice]
type=text
description=<<EOT
Used to specify an alternative interface to use for ARP/DHCP monitoring.  Useful when a local SPAN is present as monitoring
DHCP without a SPAN may result in static DHCP false positives (DHCPRENEWs are unicast).  This option will likely be deprecated
in favor of an "arp" interface type in future versions.
EOT

[arp.heartbeat]
type=time
description=<<EOT
To eliminate the negative effects of switch flooding of poisoned ARPs on some (cough...cough...Netgear MR814v2) routers, we 
must first send a valid ARP to establish that the system is on-line.  The heartbeat is the length of time between the initial
"hello" and a poisoned "goodbye".
EOT

[arp.stuffing]
type=toggle
options=enabled|disabled
description=<<EOT
If enabled, forces PF system to "stuff" router ARP cache with a bogus MAC for systems that are not responding.  This 
option effectively increases the "stickiness" of traps by suppressing broadcast ARP traffic from the gateway.  It is also 
somewhat dangerous in that it relies on systems to issue a GARP (gratuitous ARP) at boot to reclaim previously stuffed 
addresses.
EOT

[network.mode]
type=toggle
options=arp|dhcp|vlan
description=<<EOT
Defines the mode in which PacketFence will operate.

When deployed in arp mode, PacketFence uses ARP manipulation inject itself into the datastream of unregistered or 
trapped nodes.  The major failing of arp mode is that 
it's not 100% in catching all traffic - spurious packets can and will occasionaly get through.
EOT

[network.dhcpdetector]
type=toggle
options=enabled|disabled
description=<<EOT
If enabled, PacketFence will monitor DHCP-specific items such as rogue DHCP services, DHCP-based OS fingerprinting, computername/hostname 
resolution, and (optionnally) option-82 location-based information.  The monitored DHCP packets are DHCPDISCOVERs and DHCPREQUESTs - both are broadcasts, 
meaning a span port is not necessary.  This feature is highly recommended if the internal network is DHCP-based.
EOT

[network.dhcpoption82logger]

[trapping.immediate]
type=toggle
options=enabled|disabled
description=<<EOT
Enable this if you want to see lots of "IP conflict boxes on Windows systems!  On detection of a violation, a spoofed GARP 
(gratitous ARP) is sent to the offending system.  This causes it to think another system is using its IP address and, under 
Windows 2000, causes it to disable its IP stack.  When the user manages to get the system back on the wire (ipconfig 
/release, reboot, etc) he/she will be assigned an address from the isolation scope.

Method by which content is delivered to trapped systems.  When set to "proxy", PacketFence uses Apache's reverse proxy 
functionality and the mod_proxy_html module to rewrite links.  Note that links external servers will not be properly 
rewritten.  When set to "iptables", PacketFence creates passthroughs to the content for only those nodes trapped with the
corresponding violation.  Be aware that an iptables passthrough is based on IP address and clients will be able to get to
ALL content on the destination site.
