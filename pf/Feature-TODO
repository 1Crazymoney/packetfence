x Pragmatically test for memory leaks (since we can't realistically check all the code, modules)
x fully test and rubberstamp freeradius2 support (do wired 802.1x, wireless-802.1x and MAB)
- our rpm package will depend on freeradius2 (and its -perl)
-- modify install doc
- package will install rlm_perl_packetfence in /etc/raddb/? (how?)
- package will modify the config to activate the module and eap, etc.

x rename all node fields in ui.conf to point out that switch, port, voip andd connection_type are Last seen values
x rename all node vlan fields in ui.conf to point out the fact that VLAN is "My VLAN" and hide from node view by default

- Upgrade rlm_perl_packetfence_sql.pl to use new database (not so sure anymore..)
- What can we do that is better than returning -1 to a radius client?
- We'll have to think about how to close locationlog entries for radius authorize requests.. (after a day?)

- If we are in MAB or wired 802.1x do we still get traps? If so, we must find a way to ignore them I guess?
- think about easy guest support wired / wireless and pick between, etc

- create a connection type chart like the OS one

- File bug once merged

Tests
- switch in mode registration, MAB and 802.1x should not interfere with VLAN already set in config
- test the RLM_MODULE_USERLOCK return if user must be kicked out (does this work?)
- Don't act on trap answer: what happens?
- Switch doesn't exist in switches.conf: what happens?
- test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with a string 
- test pfcmd_vlan setAllVlan with a string
- test pfcmd_vlan setDefaultVlan
- test pfcmd_vlan isolate
x test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with -vlan AND -vlanName (expect error)
x test pfcmd_vlan setVlan without -vlan nor -vlanName (expect error)
x add tests to setVlanByName and test error conditions
- on parse config bail if a vlan in switches.conf is not numeric (unless if empty)
x worried about SOAP::Lite client thread safety, need to do extensive testing on rlm_perl_packetfence (might have to surround the whole SOAP thing with an eval which would be dirty dirty) -- it survived our virulent test cases
x Performance testing with radclient / radtest (simulate a lot of radius clients)

- Test a setup with a Cisco Voice VLAN (stimulate the getVoiceVlan code path)
x Update NEWS and UPGRADE on feature merge

FUTURE
- consider renaming locationlog to connectionlog (or access log)
