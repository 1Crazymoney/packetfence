- Pragmatically test for memory leaks (since we can't realistically check all the code, modules)
10 threads with millions of jobs each should do it

Tests
test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with a string 
test pfcmd_vlan setAllVlan with a string
test pfcmd_vlan setDefaultVlan
test pfcmd_vlan isolate
DONE: test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with -vlan AND -vlanName (expect error)
DONE: test pfcmd_vlan setVlan without -vlan nor -vlanName (expect error)
DONE: add tests to setVlanByName and test error conditions
on parse config bail if a vlan in switches.conf is not numeric (unless if empty)
worried about SOAP::Lite client thread safety, need to do extensive testing on rlm_perl_packetfence (might have to surround the whole SOAP thing with an eval which would be dirty dirty)
Performance testing with radclient / radtest (simulate a lot of radius clients)

- Update NEWS and UPGRADE on feature merge
NEWS
- pfcmd_vlan now allows you to specify -vlanName for -setVlan and -setAllVlan (where vlan name is the same as what is defined in switches.conf)

UPGRADE
- deprecated subs
lib/pf/SNMP.pm's setIsolationVlan, setRegistrationVlan and setNormalVlan are now deprecated and will be removed in the future. Use setVlanByName($ifIndex, $switch_locker_ref, $vlanName) instead. For example: setVlanByName($ifIndex, \%switch_locker, 'guestVlan'); 

- SOAP handler changed
The URI of the SOAP handler changed from http://www.packetfence.org/PFEvents to http://www.packetfence.org/PFAPI. To better reflect the fact that it is not just an event handling server. You will need to upgrade your remote snort probes with the new PacketFence remote snort sensor RPM or manually change the URI.
