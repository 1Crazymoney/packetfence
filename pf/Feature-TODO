- Pragmatically test for memory leaks (since we can't realistically check all the code, modules)
10 threads with millions of jobs each should do it

Tests
test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with a string 
test pfcmd_vlan setAllVlan with a string
test pfcmd_vlan setDefaultVlan
test pfcmd_vlan isolate
DONE: test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with -vlan AND -vlanName (expect error)
DONE: test pfcmd_vlan setVlan without -vlan nor -vlanName (expect error)
DONE: add tests to setVlanByName and test error conditions
on parse config bail if a vlan in switches.conf is not numeric (unless if empty)

- Update NEWS and UPGRADE on feature merge
NEWS
- pfcmd_vlan now allows you to specify -vlanName for -setVlan and -setAllVlan (where vlan name is the same as what is defined in switches.conf)

UPGRADE
- deprecated subs
lib/pf/SNMP.pm's setIsolationVlan, setRegistrationVlan and setNormalVlan are now deprecated and will be removed in the future. Use setVlanByName($ifIndex, $switch_locker_ref, $vlanName) instead. For example: setVlanByName($ifIndex, \%switch_locker, 'guestVlan');
