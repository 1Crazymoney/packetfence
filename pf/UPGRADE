Notes on upgrading from an older release
----------------------------------------

o Upgrading from a version prior to <version>:

    - Fixed an issue with CLI transport for switches/APs: for SSH make sure you
    have 'SSH' and not 'ssh'. Look into the 'Configuration->Switches' or edit
    /usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf
    - 802.1x module expects 'guest' instead of 'visitor' in node.pid
    We changed the naming of the guest concept from visitor to guest. If you
    allow guests on your network, doublecheck your rlm_perl_packetfence.pl 
    module and align it on your naming (update all to guest or change back to 
    visitor).

    - Output of node lookup changed
    The output of `pfcmd lookup node <mac>` changed. Make sure you update your 
    parsing scripts (if any). This also affects the Node lookup section of the
    Web Admin interface.

o Upgrading from a version prior to 1.8.5:

    - 802.1X freeradius module updated 
    pfcmd_ap.pl's code has been integrated in rlm_perl_packetfence.pl. If you 
    need the performance benefit from this transition, you have two options:
      1) Replace completely your rlm_perl_packetfence.pl with the new one
      2) Migrate your pfcmd_ap.pl manually
         To do so, copy all of pfcmd_ap.pl's code into a sub in 
         rlm_perl_packetfence.pl. Change all the print calls into return calls.
         Remove all exit and make sure you free resources before returning.
    If you don't need the performance improvement, leave things as they are. 
    We will be deprecating the MySQL interface in favor of a better SOAP 
    interface soon.

    - whitelisting MAC addresses is now more consistent across violation types
    Certain types of violation triggers (OS, USERAGENT, VENDORMAC) were not
    honoring the whitelist parameter. The bug is fixed but you might have 
    relied on that behaviour.

    - logging priority now shown in log files
    To improve logging readability, we now include logging priority (ex: DEBUG,
    INFO, WARN, etc.). If you use scripts to parse PacketFence's logs you will
    need to update them.

    - Added new dependencies:
	- perl-LDAP (used to authenticate users trough LDAP during 
	  registration)
	- php-ldap (used to authenticate users connecting to the 
	  Web interface through LDAP)
	- perl-IPC-Cmd (used to generate static routes for registration and
	  isolation routed VLANs)
	- perl-SOAP-Lite (used when receiving alerts from Snort)

    - HUB violation removal
    HUB violations have been removed since they create a lot of false positives.

    - Dynamic uplink fixes
    In certain cases, PacketFence took action on switches where dynamic uplinks
    couldn't be found. The bug is fixed but you might have relied on that 
    behaviour.

    - Source of Correct/Normal VLAN changed
    Correct/Normal VLAN no longer comes from the database's node entry but from
    switches.conf. This is a modified behavior when returning the correct (aka 
    normal) VLAN (in custom_getCorrectVlan). This behavior is redefined by most
    users in lib/pf/vlan/custom.pm (or conf/pfsetvlan.pm in 1.7.x) so it should
    not have any impact for most of you. However, if you relied on the node 
    entry specifying which VLAN is the normal VLAN, this is no longer the case. 
    Now, the correct/normal VLAN is defined by the normalVlan variable in the 
    switch's entry or the default entry in switches.conf. This makes more sense
    for most new installs.


o Upgrading from a version prior to 1.8.4:

    There was no upgrade-specific documentation done prior to 1.8.5.

    - Database schema
    Always make sure that your database schema is up to date. See if upgrade 
    scripts are available in db/.
