Basic load testing on the captive portal

== using ab (apache benchmark) ==

one request: 
ab https://<server>/cgi-bin/redir.cgi

100 concurrent users doing 10 requests:
ab -c 100 -n 1000 https://<server>/cgi-bin/redir.cgi

25 concurrent users doing as many requests as possible for 5 minutes:
ab -c 25 -t 300 https://<server>/cgi-bin/redir.cgi

== using jmeter ==

An interesting concept is the Access Log Sampler which replays requests in an
access log!

TODO: 
 * improve the jmeter test by providing a better access log with the 302 
   all trimmed
 * work on some normal scripts that would test the redirects and each cgi
   pages, and one that would perform the whole flow and assert on it's success
   for integration testing
