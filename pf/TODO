This is a list of tasks that are too broad to be filed as bugs.

Cleanup / Bugfix
- Deal with TODO and FIXME tags in the code
- Extract all hardcoded strings and numbers into constants
- Regroup code for all switches using Q-BRIDGE-MIB style code in something like
  SNMP::QBridgeMIB::getMacBridgeDot1dPortHash or similar
- configurator.pl: fix or destroy 

Features
- Passthrough in vlan isolation mode
- 802.1X calling code on PacketFence's server instead of doing database queries
- Nessus scan from web admin (and show when a scan is in progress)
- Nessus scan schedules

Tests
- Detect use of non thread-safe modules like Net::Appliance::Session (look for
  ->new() calls)
