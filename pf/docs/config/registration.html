<a name=auth></a>
<b>auth</b> <i>(multi)</i><br>
Default: local<br>
Options: local|ldap|radius<br>
Method or Methods by which registering nodes will be authenticated.  Templates for LDAP and local are 
available at /usr/local/pf/conf/authentication.  If you wish to use a different authentication mechanism, simply create 
a file called /usr/local/pf/conf/authentication/<authname>.pm, fill it with the necessary data, and set 
auth=<authname>.  The default value, local, relies on a local access file in /usr/local/pf/conf/user.conf.<p>
<a name=button_text></a>
<b>button_text</b> <i>(text)</i><br>
Default: Register<br>
The button text will appear on the registration page submit button<p>
<a name=expire_deadline></a>
<b>expire_deadline</b> <i>(date)</i><br>
Default: Mon Nov 12 12:00:00 EST 2012<br>
If expire_mode is set to "deadline", this is the date (formatted as returned by the "date" command) at which 
nodes revert to an unregistered state.  This would typically be the end of a semester.<p>
<a name=expire_mode></a>
<b>expire_mode</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: window<br>
Options: window|deadline|session|disabled<br>
If set to "deadline", the expire_deadline option defines the date at which a node reverts to an unregistered 
state.  If set to "window", the window is used to determine the length of time after registration that a node
remains registered.  If set to "session", it specifies that a client should be unregistered as soon as its iplog
entry closes (or with a bit of latency - check regitration.expire_session).<p>
<a name=expire_session></a>
<b>expire_session</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 5m<br>
If expire_mode is set to "session", this is the amount of time after a node's iplog entry is closed that it reverts
to an unregistered state.<p>
<a name=expire_window></a>
<b>expire_window</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 52w<br>
If expire_mode is set to "window", this is length of time after registration that a node reverts to an unregistered state.<p>
<a name=maxnodes></a>
<b>maxnodes</b> <i>(numeric)</i><br>
Default: 0<br>
If defined, the maximum number of nodes that can be registered to a single PID.<p>
<a name=nbregpages></a>
<b>nbregpages</b> <i>(numeric)</i><br>
Default: 1<br>
The number of registration pages to show to the user.<p>
<a name=queuesize></a>
<b>queuesize</b> <i>(numeric)</i><br>
Default: 0<br>
Useful for passive deployments on very large networks, this defines the number of nodes that PacketFence 
will simultaneously trap for registration (trappings due to violation always occur).  If set to 0, this queue is disabled. <p>
<a name=range></a>
<b>range</b> <i>(text)</i><br>
Default: <br>
Address ranges/CIDR blocks that PF will force registration on.  Gateway, network, and broadcast addresses are 
ignored. If this is not defined the trapping.range will be used as the registration range.  Comma-delimiter entries
should be of the form:
<p>
a.b.c.0/24
a.b.c.0-255
a.b.c.0-a.b.c.255
a.b.c.d<p>
<a name=skip_deadline></a>
<b>skip_deadline</b> <i>(date)</i><br>
Default: Mon Nov 12 12:00:00 EST 2012<br>
If mode is set to "deadline", this is the date at which the "skip registration" option is disabled.  Date 
string is formatted as the output of the "date" command is.<p>
<a name=skip_mode></a>
<b>skip_mode</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: disabled<br>
Options: window|deadline|disabled<br>
If set to "deadline", the deadline option defines the time at which skipping registration is no longer 
an option for clients.  If set to "window", the window is used to determine the amount of time after 
first network access that a node may skip registration.<p>
<a name=skip_reminder></a>
<b>skip_reminder</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 1d<br>
Interval  that a user is re-prompted to register after skipping.  For example, if window=2w and reminder=1d, a user will
be allowed to skip for two weeks but will be re-prompted every day.<p>
<a name=skip_window></a>
<b>skip_window</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 14d<br>
The length of time that a node may skip registration.  For instance, setting it to 2880 minutes would allow 
students to skip registration for two days, giving them time to get a student ID, password, etc.<p>
