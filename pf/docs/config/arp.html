<a name=cleanshutdown></a>
<b>cleanshutdown</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: enabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, ARPs are sent to all trapped systems to re-point them to the correct gateway device at shutdown.<p>
<a name=dhcp_timeout></a>
<b>dhcp_timeout</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 8h<br>
Used in detection of systems with static IP addresses.  Looks for broadcast DHCPDISCOVERs and flags a node as rogue if it 
fails to see one before timer is exceeded.  This value should be greater than 50% of your DHCP lease time.<p>
<a name=gw_timeout></a>
<b>gw_timeout</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 1d<br>
Used in detection of systems with statically-defined gateway ARP entries.  If a system has not ARPed for the gateway 
within this interval, it is removed from the IP->MAC mappings and should be flagged as rogue by the next probe.<p>
<a name=heartbeat></a>
<b>heartbeat</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 30s<br>
To eliminate the negative effects of switch flooding of poisoned ARPs on some (cough...cough...Netgear MR814v2) routers, we 
must first send a valid ARP to establish that the system is on-line.  The heartbeat is the length of time between the initial
"hello" and a poisoned "goodbye".<p>
<a name=interval></a>
<b>interval</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 60s<br>
Interval at which poisoned ARPs ("traps") are sent to infected/unregistered systems.<p>
<a name=listendevice></a>
<b>listendevice</b> <i>(text)</i><br>
Used to specify an alternative interface to use for ARP/DHCP monitoring.  Useful when a local SPAN is present as monitoring
DHCP without a SPAN may result in static DHCP false positives (DHCPRENEWs are unicast).  This option will likely be deprecated
in favor of an "arp" interface type in future versions.<p>
<a name=strobe></a>
<b>strobe</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: enabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, sends ARP request to all IP addresses within range immediately after startup.  This allows for the internal MAC 
to IP mappings to be populated quickly.<p>
<a name=stuffing></a>
<b>stuffing</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: disabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, forces PF system to "stuff" router ARP cache with a bogus MAC for systems that are not responding.  This 
option effectively increases the "stickiness" of traps by suppressing broadcast ARP traffic from the gateway.  It is also 
somewhat dangerous in that it relies on systems to issue a GARP (gratuitous ARP) at boot to reclaim previously stuffed 
addresses.<p>
<a name=timeout></a>
<b>timeout</b> <i>(time)</i><br>
Default: 8h<br>
Length of time of inactivity after which an unresponsive system is aged out.  Hello ARPs are sent at timeout/2 
and timeout-interval to avoid prematurely timing out a system.<p>
