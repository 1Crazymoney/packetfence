<a name=dhcpdetector></a>
<b>dhcpdetector</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: enabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, PacketFence will monitor DHCP-specific items such as rogue DHCP services, DHCP-based OS fingerprinting, computername/hostname 
resolution, and (optionnally) option-82 location-based information.  The monitored DHCP packets are DHCPDISCOVERs and DHCPREQUESTs - both are broadcasts, 
meaning a span port is not necessary.  This feature is highly recommended if the internal network is DHCP-based.<p>
<a name=dhcpoption82logger></a>
<b>dhcpoption82logger</b><i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: disabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled PacketFence will monitor DHCP option82 location-based information.
This feature is only available if the dhcpdetector is activated.<p>
<a name=mode></a>
<b>mode</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: passive<br>
Options: passive|inline<br>
Defines the mode in which PacketFence will operate.  When deployed in-line, PacketFence acts as a router and requires 
internal and external interfaces to "live" on separate networks.  It's also likely that a static route for the internal 
network will need to be added to the upstream router.  The PacketFence system can act as a DHCP server or relay to 
one or more external servers.
<p>
When deployed in passive mode, PacketFence uses ARP manipulation inject itself into the datastream of unregistered or 
trapped nodes.  You can read more about the mechanics of ARP manipulation <a 
href="http://www.packetfence.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=faq#what_is_arp_manipulation_aka_poisoning_or_spoofing">here</a>.  Passive deployment has several benefits over an 
inline deployment including elimination of a performance bottleneck and single point of failure.  Its major failing is that 
it's not 100% in catching all traffic - spurious packets can and will occasionaly get through.  In an academic 
environment or environments where in-line devices are frowned upon, this failing is minor in relation to the benefits.<p>
<a name=named></a>
<b>named</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: disabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, run a nameserver locally.  Combined with a 53/udp redirection port, this can allow you redirect clients based on 
name resolution versus HTTP interception.  There are several caveats to keep in mind, First, many clients cache DNS 
responses which may interrupt connectivity even after successful registration/remediation.  Second, in practice we've 
noticed issues with the local nameserver refusing to answer queries in some cases - this may be related to 
netfilter connection tracking.
<p>
If you're running DHCP locally, though, it may make sense to run a nameserver locally as well rather than defining external 
servers to passthrough.  Note that running either DHCP or DNS on a passive deployed PF system establishes dependencies on it 
that are likely not wanted.<p>
<a name=nat></a>
<b>nat</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: disabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, NATs outgoing traffic to the external interface IP address.  This setting is only useful in an in-line 
deployment.  Enabling in a passive environment will likely cause network issues for trapped nodes.  Enabling this option 
also forces snort to listen on the internal interface - this could have performance implications in high-throughput 
environments.<p>
<a name=rogueinterval></a>
<b>rogueinterval</b> <i>(numeric)</i><br>
Default: 1<br>
When rogue DHCP server detection is enabled, this parameter defines how often to email administrators.  With its default 
setting of 10, it will email administrators the details of the previous 10 DHCP offers.<p>
<a name=vlan></a>
<b>vlan</b> <i>(toggle)</i><br>
Default: disabled<br>
Options: enabled|disabled<br>
If enabled, VLAN based isolation is used. You have to manually start the pfsetvlan service for this to work.
