== Install guest registration with email confirmation ==
 * Install MIME::Lite::TT. On RHEL/CentOS: yum install perl-MIME-Lite-TT
 * Poke a hole in conf/templates/httpd.conf. Place the following statements next to cgi-bin rewrite rules under *:443 virtualhost section:
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/cgi-bin/guest.cgi
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/cgi-bin/email_activation.cgi
 * Add new rewrite rules allowing activation before the long series of RewriteCond under *:443 virtualhost:
  # Email activation clean URL to cgi conversion
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/activate/.+$
  # [PT] here allows us to mix ScriptAlias and mod_rewrite stuff
  RewriteRule ^/activate/([0-9a-z]+)$ https://%%hostname%%.%%domain%%/cgi-bin/email_activation.cgi?code=$1 [PT]
 * Create new database table. Run:
  mysql -u root -p pf -v < addons/guest-email-confirmation/schema.sql
 * Redirect the user to cgi-bin/guest.cgi for guest registration
 * Activate node expiration in conf/pf.conf. As a workaround for a bug, we need to set a ridiculous long window expiration. This will be fixed in the future. Under [registration] add:
  # Workaround to activate expiration
  expire_mode=window
  expire_window=999w
 * Reduce the maintenance_interval so nodes unregister quicker than every 10 minutes. In conf/pf.conf under [general] add:
  maintenance_interval=30s
 * Add a guest category. Do it with the web admin or Run the following:
  pfcmd nodecategory add name=guest

== Customization ==
 * HTML templates:
  Guest registration page: html/user/content/templates/guest.html
  Page shown once activated: html/user/content/templates/activated.html
 * The email template is: conf/templates/emails-guest_activation.txt.tt
