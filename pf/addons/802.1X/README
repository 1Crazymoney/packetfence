1) Prepare PF
   Add a section in <install_dir>/conf/switches.conf for the access point,
   similar to the following
     [192.168.0.34]
     ip = 192.168.0.34
     type = Cisco::Aironet_1242
     mode = production

2) Configure Freeradius
   Copy the files rlm_perl_packetfence.pl into the Freeradius configuration
   directory. Then modify radiusd.conf so that it uses rlm_perl_packetfence.pl
   (follow the instructions at http://wiki.freeradius.org/Rlm_perl) 

3) Configure rlm_perl_packetfence.pl
   Edit rlm_perl_packetfence.pl specifying your database connection settings
   and your VLAN configuration.
