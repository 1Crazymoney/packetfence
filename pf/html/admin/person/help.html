    Consult, modify and delete your Packetfence users.<br>

    Add a new Packetfence user.<br>
    Interface to the <code>pfcmd person add</code> command.<br>
    You'll use this command only in some rare cases since a 
    new packetfence user account allows you as an administrator
    to associate computers with this Packetfence user but it does not allow the
    user to do so himself/herself. How network users trying to register
     nodes will
    be authenticated is determined by the <code>registration.auth</code>
    configuration instruction and when such an authenticated network user 
    registers his first computer the corresponding Packetfence user 
    account whill be created automatically.
