<p>
    Consult, modify and delete your Packetfence users.<br>
    Interface to the <code>pfcmd person</code> commands.<br>
    Please note that when you delete a Packetfence user, all 
    computers registered to this user will also be deleted.

<a name="add"><h2>Add</h2></a>
<p>
    Add a new Packetfence user.<br>
    Interface to the <code>pfcmd person add</code> command.<br>
    You'll use this command only in some rare cases since a 
    new packetfence user account allows you as an administrator
    to associate computers with this Packetfence user but it does not allow the
    user to do so himself/herself. How network users trying to register
     nodes will
    be authenticated is determined by the <code>registration.auth</code>
    configuration instruction and when such an authenticated network user 
    registers his first computer the corresponding Packetfence user 
    account whill be created automatically.
