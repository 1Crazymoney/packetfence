	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Crash fix
	If we attempted to trigger a violation but no trigger for the violation
	existed, we still tried to move on and add the violation which caused
	the use of a 0 in an hash reference thus a crash.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Fix a crash that happens if violation classes are
	corrupted and a vlan change is required (like when a violation is
	created)

	* Renamed pf/addons/high-availability/named-init-script-lsb-fix.patch
	to pf/addons/high-availability/named-9.2-init-script-lsb-fix.patch:
	bind 9.2 exposed wrong behavior but bind 9.3 is fine and patch doesn't
	apply anyway

2009-09-11	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22 and 
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Block misbehaving User Agents
	Block at the apache level some User Agents that we don't care about
	such as Windows Update, etc. We give them a 403 error (forbidden).
	Fixes bug #790;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=790

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm: Deactivated port security on Linksys
	Known to be broken and the telnet code was sending SIGALRM and crashing
	pfsetvlan.
	Also added some trace level logging statements. Fixes bug #797;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=797

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: pfsetvlan stops on SIGALRM signal
	Die is properly sent to log4perl. No more misterious stops without any
	error. Alarm signals are known to be buggy with threaded perl. Fixes 
	bug #796;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=796

2009-08-25	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Install Guide updated
	Details
	- version bump
	- yum update before rpmforge install
	- removed priorities requirement (not sure about this one)
	- updated installation procedure to reflect new yum repo
	- re-generated ToC so that updating the table works with OpenOffice 3.1
	- added index links to the ToC elements, it now creates a linkified PDF
	- switch setup now points to the Admin Guide for more switch config
	samples and supported devices list
	- re-org: switches definition before custom trap handling functions 
	since pf's new behavior is based on switch definition rather than 
	per-node
	- explained new correctVlan behavior
	- modifed switches definition to outline the fact that vlan number can
	be overloaded in a specific switch from the default
	- some minor prettification
	- mentionned new support packages and added meat in commecial support 
	section
