	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm: Deactivated port security on Linksys
	Known to be broken and the telnet code was sending SIGALRM and crashing
	pfsetvlan.
	Also added some trace level logging statements. Fixes bug #797;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=797

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: pfsetvlan stops on SIGALRM signal
	Die is properly sent to log4perl. No more misterious stops without any
	error. Alarm signals are known to be buggy with threaded perl. Fixes 
	bug #796;

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Install Guide updated
	Details
	- version bump
	- yum update before rpmforge install
	- removed priorities requirement (not sure about this one)
	- updated installation procedure to reflect new yum repo
	- re-generated ToC so that updating the table works with OpenOffice 3.1
	- added index links to the ToC elements, it now creates a linkified PDF
	- switch setup now points to the Admin Guide for more switch config
	samples and supported devices list
	- re-org: switches definition before custom trap handling functions 
	since pf's new behavior is based on switch definition rather than 
	per-node
	- explained new correctVlan behavior
	- modifed switches definition to outline the fact that vlan number can
	be overloaded in a specific switch from the default
	- some minor prettification
	- mentionned new support packages and added meat in commecial support 
	section
