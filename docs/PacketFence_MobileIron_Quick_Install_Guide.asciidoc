About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to help sales engineers, product managers, or network specialists demonstrate the PacketFence capabilities on-site with an existing or potential customer.  It can also provide guidelines to setup a proof of concept for a potential PacketFence deployment using the Mobile Iron mobile device manager.

Assumptions
-----------
* You have a configured PacketFence environment with working test equipment
* You have access to a Mobile Iron cloud account

Quick installation
------------------
Step 1: Configure Mobile Iron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all you will need to configure the basic functionnality of Mobile Iron using their documentation.

MDM profile
^^^^^^^^^^^
One important step is to enable the MDM profile like in this screenshot. 
Note that this will require you to create an MDM certificate with Apple. Refer to the Mobile Iron documentation for specifics about this step.

Create an API user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next, we'll need a user that has the rights to access the Mobile Iron API in order to verify the state of the devices directly from PacketFence.

First go in the USERS & DEVICES tab and then in Users and click Add local user

Now enter the information about your user and note the user ID and password for usage in the PacketFence configuration, then hit save.

Now go in the ADMIN tab, check the box next to your newly created user and then in Actions select Assign to space

Select the Global space at the top and then check API at the bottom.
You should now see API in the roles list of your newly created user when viewing the users list.

Step 2: Configure PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In PacketFence, MDM are refered to as provisioners. 
This will walk you through adding MobileIron as a provisioner.

Create the provisioner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We will first need to configure a new provisioner in PacketFence.

For the name we will use mobileiron but other names are still valid.

Here are the URLs that should work by default. 
Replace accountName by your real account/instance name at Mobile Iron.

Android : https://m.mobileiron.net/accountName/c/d/android.html
IOS devices : https://m.mobileiron.net/accountName/c/d/ios.html
Windows : https://m.mobileiron.net/accountName/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc


Add the provisioner to the portal profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order for the provisionner to be used by your captive portal you need to add it in it's configuration.
Go in Portal Profiles, then select the portal you want to modify and add mobileiron as a provisioner.

Test
^^^^
You can now test that Mobile Iron is mandatory after the device registration.
Connect a device to your test network and register like you normally would.
At the end of the registration process you will be presented a page asking you to install the Mobile Iron on your device.
After you install the agent click continue. If your access is enabled than this means the connectivity between PacketFence and Mobile Iron is good.
