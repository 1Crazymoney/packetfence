About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to provide guidelines to deploy a Aerohive Wireless APs and the associated management in a PacketFence context, whether it is with a standalone server, a cluster or PacketFencZEN deployxement.

NOTE: Aerohive products are a bit different compared to the other vendors. They support either a local HiveManager (kind of wireless controller) or a cloud-based HVM. However, the configuration is the same for the local and the cloud-based controller. Note that all the config are made on the HVM and then pushed to the APs. The instructions are based on version {release_version} of the PacketFence.

Assumptions
-----------
* You already have a PacketFence server(s) up and running, (standalone, cluster or ZEN)
  ** If not, please refer to the https://packetfence.org/doc/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.html[PacketFence Administration Guide].
* The network architecture is in order to give acces to the Aerohive Access Point, and has access to internet
* The VLANs are defined for registration, isolation and management networks
 * From this documentation, we will assume that the VLANs tags are define like following :
  ** Registration VLAN ID 2,sSubnet 192.168.2.0/24
  ** Isolation VLAN ID 3, subnet 192.168.3.0/24
  ** Production VLAN ID 10, subnet 172.16.1.0/24
* The VLANs are spanned in the switches and switching L2 equipments, from the _Production Network_ to the PacketFence server(s)
* The VLANs are allowed in the trunks
* Aerohive Access Point is loaded with HiveOS with version 6 or later
* HiveManager with version 6 or later

'''

Quick Deployment
----------------
Step 1: Set-Up the Aerohive APs and SSID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logon to your HiveManager interface::
For this example, we will assume that we are on the _Cloud_ https://myhive-auth.aerohive.com[MyHive.aerohove.com] solution
* From _HiveManager_, Click on your *HiveManagerOnline Instances* _VHM-XXXXXX_
* From _Network Configuration / 1-Choose Network Policy_, Click on *New*
* Give a name to your Policy, and click *Create*
* From _2-Configure Interfaces and User Access_, _SSID_, Click on *Choose* and Click on *New*
* Give a SSID Profile Name, SSID Name 

For an open SSID using MAC-based authentication::
* Click on *New*
 .  SSID Access Security: *Open*
 . Check the box _Enable MAC authentication_
* Click on *Save*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive02.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AerohiveOpenSSIDconfig",align=right]

'''


For a secure SSID using 802.1X::
* Click on *New*

 SSID Access Security: *WPA/WPA2 802.1X (Enterprise)*
 Key Management; WPA2-(WPA2 enterprise)-802.1X
 Encryption method: CCMP (AES)

image::docs/images/pfaerohive03.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AerohiveSecuredSSIDconfig",align=right]
* Click on *Save*
* From SSID, be sure to have selected both SSIDs previously created, and click *OK*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive04.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AerohiveSSID",align=center]

'''


Add the RADIUS parameters created before::
* Under _Authentication_ click on *<RADIUS Setting>*, and click on *New*
* From _RADIUS Name_, give the name of the PaketFence server, for example

image::docs/images/pfaerohive05.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AAA Radius config",align=right]

* From _Add a New RADIUS Server_, in _IP Adresse/Domain Name_, put the PacketFence Server IP
* Give the _Shared Secret_ and _Confirm_ it
* And Click on *Apply*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive06.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AAA Radius config",align=right]

* Deploye the _Optionnal Setting(not supported by RADIUS Proxy)_ section and * [x] check the _Permit Dynamic Change of Authorization Message (RFC 3576)_
* Click on *Save*
:
* Next to your _SSID Name_ Click on the *<RADIUS Setting>*, Click *OK*

'''


We will create the default VLAN to be assign by the AP, when a new endpoint get in the SSID ::
* Under _User Profile_, Click on *Add/Remove*,and Click on *New*, in the _Default_ section
 ** You will need to create one _User Profile_ for each VLANs used, for us, we will create 3 Users Profiles, Registration, Isolation and Production
* From name, give the name of a rule to manage the VLANs with PacketFence (Registration ; Isolation ; Production)
* From _Attribute Name_, give the VLAN ID of the VLAN
* From _Default VLan_, Click on the (*+*) (New)
* As a VLan ID, give the VLAN ID earlier Registration(2) , Isolation(3) or Production(10)
* Click on *Save* and click on *Save* again on the _Configure interfaces and User Access_

image::docs/images/pfaerohive07.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="User Profile creation",align=right]

'''


Create and add the other VLANs ::
* Follow the same procedure to create the others VLANs

'''


Once done with the VLANs configuration::
* From the _Choose User Profiles_, select the _Default_ tab and click on you _Registration_ VLAN tag
* From the _Authentication_ tab, select the _Isolation_ and the _Production_ VLANs tag
* Click on *Save*

For our example, here is  what it looks like, with two SSIDs

image::docs/images/pfaerohive08.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="User Profile creation",align=right]

Then, click on _Continue_, on top right of the page

'''

Push your configuration to your AP::
* From _Configure and Update Devices_, check your AP in _Device to Update_
* Click on _Update_
* Select _update Devices_
* From _HiveOS Number of devices running earlier versions of HiveOS_, select *Upgrade these devices to the latest version of HiveOS*
* Click on _Update_
* Wait untill the date and time apprears under _Update Status_


Step 2: Configure Network and PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring Aerohive access point in PacketFence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will now need to create a new switch, in PacketFence to be able to manage the endpoints behind the Aerohive APs

Logon to your PacketFence interface::
* From _Configuration / Policies and Access Control / Switches /_
* On the line where there is the _default_, on the right, Click on _CLONE_


image::docs/images/pfaerohive09.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="New switch configuration",align=right]


'''


In _Definition_ ::
* _IP Address/MAC Address/Range (CIDR)_, give the network address of your _Production_ network; For us, it will be *172.16.1.0/24*
* _Description_, give a description so you can quickly see what it is about
* From the _Type_ list, select *Aerohive AP*
* From _Mode_ select *Production*
* _Switch Group_ by default set to *None*
* _Deauthentication Method_ set to *RADIUS*
* Click *SAVE*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive10.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="New switch configuration",align=right]


'''


In _Role_ ::
* Set all VLans ID in each roles

image::docs/images/pfaerohive11.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="New switch configuration",align=right]


'''


In _RADIUS_ ::
* Modify the secret passphrase previously sets in the Aerohive HiveManager
* Click on *SAVE*

This ends the PacketFence configuration

'''

Web Auth Configuration
----------------------

In this part we will describe the WebAuth configuration for Aerohive APs


Assumption :
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this part, the default VlAN must be the native VLAN.
This way, the AP and the others networks equipments will be able to manage VLANs 


'''

Step 1 : Configure the Wireless APs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new Captive Portal Profile::
* From the HiveManager, go to *CONFIGURATION -> ADVANCED CONFIGURATION -> AUTHENTICATION -> Captive Web Portals*
* Click on *New*
* Give it a name
* _Registration Type_ must be *External Authentication*
* Click on _Captive Web Portal Login Page Settings_ to deploy the configuration window
* _Login URL_ must be *http://YOUR_PACKETFENCE_SERVER_IP/Aerohive::AP*
* _Password Encryption_ : *No Encryption (Plaintext Password)*
* Click on *Save*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive14.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Captive Portal SSID configuration",align=right]

Create or modify an SSID to add the Captive Portal fonction::
* From the HiveManager, go to *CONFIGURATION -> SSIDS -> Select your SSID.*
* From _SSID Access Security_ , Check *Enable Captive Web Portal*
* Click *Save*

* From the HiveManager, go to *CONFIGURATION -> NETWORK POLICIES*, Select your policy
* From _Configure Interfaces and User Access_, you will now have a _CWP_ symbol under _Authentication_.
* Under _User Profile_ , click on *Add/Remove* and select the _default-profile_ (1) option to have the native VLAN as default
* Click on *Save*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive12.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Captive Portal SSID configuration",align=right]


'''

Push your configuration to your AP::
* From _Configure and Update Devices_, check your AP in _Device to Update_
* Click on _Update_
* Select _update Devices_
* From _HiveOS Number of devices running earlier versions of HiveOS_, select *Upgrade these devices to the latest version of HiveOS*
* Click on _Update_
* Wait until the date and time appears under _Update Status_



Step 2: Configure PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the _Production_ interface to send the _Portal_.
* Go to *CONFIGURATION -> NETWORK CONFIGURATION -> Interfaces*
* Under _Logical Name_, click on your interface name,
* _Additionnal listening daemon(s)_, Add *portal*
* Click on *SAVE*
