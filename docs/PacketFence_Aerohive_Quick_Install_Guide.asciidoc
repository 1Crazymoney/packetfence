About this Guide
----------------
This guide has been created in order to provide guidelines to deploye a Aeroive Wireless APs and the associated management in a PacketFence contexte, wether it is with a standalown server, a cluster or PacketFencZEN deployement.

NOTE: AeroHIVE products are a bit different compared to the other vendors. They support either a local HiveManager (kind of wireless controller) or a cloud-based HVM. However, the configuration is the same for the local and the cloud-based controller. Note that all the config are made on the HVM and then pushed to the APs. The instructions are based on version {release_version} of the PacketFence.

Assumptions
-----------
* You already have a PacketFence server(s) up and running, (Standalone, cluster or ZEN)
  ** If not, please refer to the https://packetfence.org/doc/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.html[PacketFence Administration Guide].
* The network architecture is in order to give acces to the Aerohive Access Point, and have access to internet.
* The VLANs are defined for registration, isolation and management networks.
 * From this doc, we will assume that the VLANs tags are define like following :
  ** Registration VLAN ID 2, Subnet 192.168.2.0/24,
  ** Isolation VLAN ID 3, Subnet 192.168.3.0/24,
  ** Production VLAN ID 10, Subnet 172.16.1.0/24,
* The VLans are spanned in the swtichs and switching L2 equipments, from the _Production Network_ to the PacketFenceServer(s)
* The VLANs are allowed in the trunks.
* Aerohive Access Point is loaded with HiveOS with version 6 or later;
* HiveManager with version 6 or later.

Quick Deployment
----------------
Step 1: Set-Up the Aerohive APs and SSID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logon to your Hive Manager interface::
For this example, we will assume that we are on the _Cloud_ https://myhive-auth.aerohive.com[MyHive.aerohove.com] solution.
* From _HiveManager_, Click on your *HiveManagerOnline Instances* _VHM-XXXXXX_
* From _Network Configuration / 1-Choose Network Policy_, Click on *New*
* Give a name to your Policy, and click *Create*
* From _2-Configure Interfaces and User Access_, _SSID_, Click on *Choose* and Click on *New*
* Give a SSID Profile Name, SSID Name, 

For a Open Mac Authentication based SSID::
* Click on *New*.
 .  SSID Access Security: Open
 . Check the box Enable MAC authentication
* Click on *Save*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive02.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AerohiveOpenSSIDconfig",align=right]

'''


For a Secured based SSID::
* Click on *New*.

 SSID Access Security: *WPA/WPA2 802.1X (Enterprise)*
 Key Management; WPA2-(WPA2 enterprise)-802.1X
 Encryption method: CCMP (AES)

image::docs/images/pfaerohive03.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AerohiveSecuredSSIDconfig",align=right]
* Click on *Save*
* From SSID, be sure to have selected both SSIDs previously created, and click *OK*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive04.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AerohiveSSID",align=center]

'''


Add the RADIUS parameters created before::
* Under _Authentication_ click on *<RADIUS Setting>*, and click on *New*
* From _RADIUS Name_, give the name of the PaketFence server, for example,

image::docs/images/pfaerohive05.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AAA Radius config",align=right]

* From _Add a New RADIUS Server_, in _IP Adresse/Domain Name_, put the PacketFence Server IP
* Give the _Shared Secret_ and _Confirm_ it.
* And Click on *Apply*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive06.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="AAA Radius config",align=right]

* Deploye the _Optionnal Setting(not supported by RADIUS Proxy)_ section and * [x] check the _Permit Dynamic Change of Authorization Message (RFC 3576)_
* Click on *Save*
:
* Next to your _SSID Name_ Click on the *<RADIUS Setting>*, Click *OK*

'''


We will create the default VLAN to be assign by the AP, when a new Terminal get in the SSID ::
* Under _User Profile_, Click on *Add/Remove*,and Click on *New*, in the _Default_ section,
 ** You will need to greate one _User Profile_ for each VLANs used, for us, we will create 3 Users Profiles, Registration, Isolation and Production.
* From Name, give the Name of a rules to Manage the VLANs with PacketFence (Registration ; Isolation ; Production).
* From _Attribute Name_ , give the VLAN ID of the VLAN.
* From Default VLan, Click on the (*+*) (New).
* As a VLan ID, give the VLAN ID earlier Registration(2) , Isolation(3) or Production(10).
* Click on *Save* and click on *Save* again on the _Configure interfaces and User Access_.

image::docs/images/pfaerohive07.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="User Profile creation",align=right]

'''


Create and add the other VLANs ::
* Click on _Add/Remove_ in the _User Profile_ column.
* Get back to the beginning of the VLAN creation task.

'''


Once done with the VLans ::
* From the _Choose User Profiles_, select the _Default_ tab and Click on you _Registration_ VLAN tag.
* From the _Authentication_ tab, select the _Isolation_ and the _Production_ VLANs tag. 
* Click on *Save*

For our example, here what is lookslike, with two SSIDs

image::docs/images/pfaerohive08.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="User Profile creation",align=right]

Then, click on Continue, on top right of the page.

'''

Push your configuration to your AP::
* From _Configure and Update Devices_, check your AP in _Device to Update_
* Click on _Update_
* Select _update Devices_
* From _HiveOS Number of devices running earlier versions of HiveOS_, select *Upgrade these devices to the latest version of HiveOS*
* Click on _Update_
* Wait untill the date and time apprears under _Update Status_


Step 2: Configure Network and PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring Aerohive access point in PacketFence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will nowneed to create a new switch, in PacketFence to be able to manage the terminals behind the Aerohive APs.

Logon to your PacketFence interface::
* From _Configuration / Policies and Access Control / Switches /_
* On the line where there is the _default_, on the right, Click on _CLONE_.


image::docs/images/pfaerohive09.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="New switch configuration",align=right]

'''


In _Definition_ ::
* _IP Address/MAC Address/Range (CIDR)_, give the network adress of your _Production_ network,for us, it will be *172.16.1.0/24*
* _Description_, give a description so you can quickly see what it is about,
* From the _Type_ list, select *AeroHIVE AP*.

NOTE: *TIP*: You can type directly the name you are looking forin the field

* From _Mode_ select *Production*
* _Switch Group_ by defaultset to *None*.
* _Deauthentication Method_ set to *RADIUS*
* Click *SAVE*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive10.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="New switch configuration",align=right]

'''


In _Role_ ::
* Set all VLans ID in each roles.

image::docs/images/pfaerohive11.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="New switch configuration",align=right]

'''


In _RADIUS_ ::
* Modify the secret passphrase previously sets in the AeroHive Hive Manager,
* Click on *SAVE*

This end the PacketFence configuration.

'''

Web Auth Configuration
----------------------

In this part we will describe the WebAuth configuration for Aerohive APs.


Assumption :
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We will use the same previous contexte, but we will have only one VLAN, the Production (11)
Keep in mind that we will also use the natvite VLAN tag (1) as default one.


'''

Step 1 : Configure the Wireless APs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new Captive Portal Profile::
* From the HiveManager, go to *CONFIGURATION -> ADVANCED CONFIGURATION -> AUTHENTICATION -> Captive Web Portals*
* Click on *New*
* Give it a name,
* _Registration Type_ must be *External Authentication*
* Click on _Captive Web Portal Login Page Settings_ to deploye the configuration window.
* _Login URL_ must be *http://YOUR_PACKETFENCE_SERVER_IP/AeroHIVE::AP*
* _Password Encryption_ : *No Encryption (Plaintext Password)*
* Click on *Save*

image::docs/images/pfaerohive14.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Captive Portal SSID configuration",align=right]

NOTE: It is not recommended to use a unique SSID for other authentication methode (Mac Auth, 802.1x, ...)

Create or modify an SSID to add the Captive Portal fonction::
* From the HiveManager, go to *CONFIGURATION -> SSIDS -> Select your SSID.*
* From _SSID Access Security_ , Check *Enable Captive Web Portal*
* Click *Save*

* From the HiveManager, go to *CONFIGURATION -> NETWORK POLICIES*, Select your policy,
* From _Configure Interfaces and User Access_, you will now have a _CWP_ symbole under _Authentication_.
* Under _User Profile_ , Click on *Add/Remove* and select the _default-profile_ (1) optionto have the native VLAN as default.
* Click on *Save*

'''

Push your configuration to your AP::
* From _Configure and Update Devices_, check your AP in _Device to Update_
* Click on _Update_
* Select _update Devices_
* From _HiveOS Number of devices running earlier versions of HiveOS_, select *Upgrade these devices to the latest version of HiveOS*
* Click on _Update_
* Wait untill the date and time apprears under _Update Status_



Step 2: Configure PacketFence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the _Production_ interface to send the _Portal_.
* Go to *CONFIGURATION -> NETWORK CONFIGURATION -> Interfaces*
