Step 2: Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Try to do a connection to packetfence, if you user is match a correct rule with the role that you have configured, the packetfence server will send a request to the Barracuda to allow you.

If you want to see if it's working, you can log into the Barracuda in SSH and run this command following commands: acpfctrl auth show

[options="compact"]
* *[root@baracudafw:~]# acpfctrl auth show
* *1 entries
* *172.20.20.152/0
* *	origin=PacketFence
* *	service=PacketFence
