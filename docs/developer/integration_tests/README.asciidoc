=== Integration tests

The aim of integration tests is to test common PacketFence scenarios and
integrations in a pipeline.

Integration tests rely on:

* <<_virtual_environment>>
* network topologies built using `libvirt` footnote:[based on Cumulus Networks's project link:https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant[cldemo]]
* virtual machines different than PacketFence to test integrations
