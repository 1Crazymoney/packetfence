//=== Bluesocket

==== MAC Authentication

===== Bluesocket side

In order to configure mac authentication on the Bluesocket, you must have access to the controller.

First, you must configure a RadiusWebAuthServer in External Authentication and enable "Enable Radius MAC Authentication" and add Authentications rules.

This Authentication Rules needs to match the PacketFence role you define to the Bluesocket role you defined.

Next you have to create an SSID in Wireless -> SSIDs and important, check for "Enable Captive Portal Authentication".

===== PacketFence side

You have to define the ip address of the Blusocket controller in PacketFence.

Since the vlan assignation is made by role, you need to enable role by switch role and define the role you previously created in the Bluesocket "Authentications rules".

For the deauthentication you need to select HTTPS and fill the Web Services section with the username and password to connect to the Bluesocket API.

==== 802.1x

First, you must configure a Radius1XAuthServer in External Authentication.
