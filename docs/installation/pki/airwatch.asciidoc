//=== PacketFence PKI

This section has been created to give a quick overview to configure AirWatch (WMware) with PacketFence. This guide does not include advanced troubleshooting of EAP-TLS connections. Refer to the relevant documentation of EAP-TLS, RADIUS and OpenSSL for advanced features. The PKI comes installed by default since PacketFence version 10. All certificates would be saved in the database. If you want to migrate your certificate from the old PacketFence PKI please see the upgrade section.

==== Assumptions

You have a fonctional PacketFence PKI and you already have created a Certificate Authority and its templates with SCEP enabled. The template used here is: 'airwatch2' 

NOTE: Make sure that your PacketFence PKI Root CA validity is under 825 days and your PacketFence PKI Template is under 398 days. References: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211025 and https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT210176

===== Create the Certicate Authority (SCEP):
