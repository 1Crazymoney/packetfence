//=== Kandji

==== Configure Kandji

First of all you will need to configure the basic functionality of Kandji using their documentation and enable a blueprint to apply on your devices.

==== Create an API token

Next, we will need a user that has the rights to access the Kandji API in order to verify the state of the devices directly from PacketFence.

In the Kandji admin panel, first go in the 'Settings' tab and then in 'Access'.

Note down the value of `Your organizationâ€™s API URL` for usage in the PacketFence configuration.

Now, click 'Add token' under 'API token'.

Create your API token by giving it a meaningful name and you will then be presented the API token

Note the API token for usage in the PacketFence configuration, then hit 'Next'.

==== Configure the API permissions

After creating your API token, you will be offered the option to configure the API permissions for the token, you should select the following permissions:

[options="compact"]
* Device list (`/devices`)
* Device ID (`/devices/{device_id}`)

==== Configure PacketFence

In PacketFence, MDM are referred to as provisioners. 
This will walk you through adding Kandji as a provisioner.

===== Create the provisioner

Login in the PacketFence administration interface, then go in the 'Configuration' tab, then in 'Provisioners'.
Click 'Add provisioner' then select 'Kandji'.

Now configure this new provisioner with the information you got above.

[options="compact"]
* The API token is the token you obtained in the instructions above
* The host is obtained by the value of your organization's API URL. For example, if your API URL is `https://foo.clients.us-1.kandji.io/api/v1/`, the host will be `foo.clients.us-1.kandji.io`
* The enroll URL can be obtained in the 'Add devices' menu of the Kandji admin panel under 'Enrollment Portal Link'

===== Add the provisioner to the connection profile

In order for the provisioner to be used by your captive portal you need to add it in its configuration.
Go in 'Connection Profiles', then select the portal you want to modify and add your new provisioner in the list.

==== Add the necessary passthroughs

NOTE: This step is only necessary if you wish to enroll devices via the PacketFence captive-portal. Adding these passthroughs may prevent the Apple CNA (Captive-Network Assistant) from opening when the user is unregistered.

Next, still in the PacketFence administration console, go in 'Fencing' in the left menu, then scroll then to 'Passthroughs'.

Check the 'Passthrough' box above the field and add the following domains to the passthrough list.

[options="compact"]
* `<your instance>.<your region>.kandji.io` (this is your API URL)
* `*.devices.<your region>.kandji.io` (you can obtain your region from the API URL)
* `*.hs-analytics.net`
* `*.hs-banner.com`
* `*.hs-scripts.com`
* `*.hsadspixel.net`
* `*.hubapi.com`
* `*.hubspot.com`
* `*.kandji.io`
* `*.push.apple.com`
* `*.usemessages.com`
* `*.web-api.kandji.io`
* `albert.apple.com`
* `deviceenrollment.apple.com`
* `deviceservices-external.apple.com`
* `gateway.icloud.com`
* `gdmf.apple.com`
* `gs.apple.com`
* `humb.apple.com`
* `identity.apple.com`
* `iprofiles.apple.com`
* `kandji-prd-managed-library-items.s3.amazonaws.com`
* `kandji-prd.s3.amazonaws.com`
* `mdmenrollment.apple.com`
* `setup.icloud.com`
* `sq-device.apple.com`
* `static.ips.apple.com`
* `tbsc.apple.com`
* `time-ios.apple.com`
* `time-macos.apple.com`
* `time.apple.com`
* `vpp.itunes.apple.com`

===== Restart PacketFence

In order to enable the boarding passthrough for the device enrollment, you will need to restart the iptables service of PacketFence.

You can do this using the command line by doing '/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd service iptables restart' or in the administration interface under 'Status / Services'.

==== Testing

You can now test that Kandji enrollment is mandatory after the device registration.
Connect a device to your test network and register like you normally would.
At the end of the registration process you will be presented a page asking you to install the Kandji MDM on your device.
After you install the agent click 'Continue'. If your access is enabled than this means the connectivity between PacketFence and Kandji is good.
