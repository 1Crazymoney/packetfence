In order to install a new PacketFence version (major or minor), you need to
update PacketFence repository definition before updating packages:

.RHEL-based systems
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
yum localinstall http://packetfence.org/downloads/PacketFence/RHEL8/packetfence-release-NEW_PF_VERSION.el8.noarch.rpm
yum update --enablerepo=packetfence
----

with `NEW_PF_VERSION` equals `11.1` for example.

.Debian-based systems
[source,bash]
----
sed -i 's/OLD_PF_VERSION/NEW_PF_VERSION/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/packetfence.list
apt update
apt install packetfence
----

with `OLD_PF_VERSION` equals `11.0` and `NEW_PF_VERSION` equals `11.1` for example.
