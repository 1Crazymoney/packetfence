After packages upgrades, you should take care to review any changes to configuration files and merge them if required.

===== RHEL-based systems

To find out which configuration files have changed run following command:

[source,bash]
----
find /usr/local/pf -name \*.rpmnew
----

The list of files returned are the new versions shipped with PacketFence.
Compare them to your existing version and see if there are changes that should
be merged into your existing configuration. Then, once you are done make sure
to delete these files so that there is no confusion the next time you upgrade
PacketFence.

===== Debian-based systems

Debian installation system should have interactively asked for existing
modified files. If you answer `No` to keep existing files in place, you can
find out which configuration files have changed by running following command:

[source,bash]
----
find /usr/local/pf -name "*.dpkg-dist"
----
