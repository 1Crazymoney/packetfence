Once packages are all upgraded, you should take care to review any changes to configuration files and merge them if required.

To find out which configuration files have changed run following command:

.RHEL-based systems
[source,bash]
----
find /usr/local/pf -name \*.rpmnew
----

.Debian-based systems
[source,bash]
----
find /usr/local/pf -name "*.dpkg-dist"
----

The list of files returned are the new versions shipped with PacketFence.
Compare them with your installed versions and see if there are changes that should
be merged into your existing configuration.

NOTE: Debian-based systems should have interactively asked for existing
modified files.

Then, once you are done make sure to delete these files so that there is no
confusion the next time you upgrade PacketFence:

[source,bash]
----
find /usr/local/pf -name \*.rpmnew -delete
find /usr/local/pf -name "*.dpkg-dist" -delete
----
